SUB = "A short reflective game on how you show up at boundaries: Identification ¬∑ Coordination ¬∑ Reflection ¬∑ Transformation"

INTRO = """
In complex work, the toughest moments live **at the boundaries** ‚Äî between roles, functions, values, and systems.

This game helps you notice your **preferred way of crossing boundaries**, based on four learning mechanisms
(Akkerman & Bakker, 2011):

- **Identification (I)** ‚Äî seeing and naming differences & purpose clearly  
- **Coordination (C)** ‚Äî building shared routines, tools, agreements  
- **Reflection (R)** ‚Äî making sense across perspectives through dialogue  
- **Transformation (T)** ‚Äî prototyping hybrid practices and embedding change

Choose what you would **most likely** do in each situation.  
At the end, you‚Äôll see your **Boundary Compass** profile, an archetype, and stretch prompts.
