**Boundary-Crossing Mechanisms (Akkerman & Bakker, 2011)**  
- **Identification (I)** ‚Äî seeing differences clearly; naming roles, goals, limits.  
- **Coordination (C)** ‚Äî building bridges via shared routines, artefacts, agreements.  
- **Reflection (R)** ‚Äî learning through perspective-taking and sense-making.  
- **Transformation (T)** ‚Äî co-creating new practices that integrate worlds.  

Leaders develop organisations not by eliminating boundaries, but by **strengthening capacity to work across them**.
