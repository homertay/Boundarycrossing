**Why this game?**

In complex work, many problems live at **boundaries** â€” between roles, functions, values, or systems.
Research shows that learning at these edges tends to happen through four mechanisms:

- **Identification (I)** â€” seeing and naming differences & boundaries clearly  
- **Coordination (C)** â€” building shared routines, tools, and agreements  
- **Reflection (R)** â€” making sense across perspectives through dialogue  
- **Transformation (T)** â€” prototyping hybrid practices and embedding change  

Choose what you would **most likely** do in each scenario. At the end, youâ€™ll see your
**Boundary Compass** profile, a **leadership archetype**, and stretch prompts to grow.
